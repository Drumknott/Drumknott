### Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my page. I'm an amateur dev who works in C# and Python. I'm a big fan of games so a lot of my projects tend to be game related. 

I've just finished a coding bootcamp with hyperiondev.com (with an average grade of 100%!) and I'm actively hunting for graduate/entery-level/junior dev jobs, so please get in touch with me if you're interested.


Some of my C# work;
* https://github.com/Drumknott/Stardew-Valley---A-Murder-Mystery - this was my first ever big project. I know the code is bad but I like to keep it around to remind me how much progress I've made.
* https://github.com/Drumknott/NPC_Generator_Call_of_Cthulhu - Create full NPCs in a single click
* https://github.com/Drumknott/Satisfactory_Factory_Planner - Plan your factory with ease

Some of my Python work;
* https://github.com/Drumknott/Task_Management_App - An app to easily assign and keep track of tasks
* https://github.com/Drumknott/FinalCapstone - an inventory/warehouse management program for keeping track of stock levels, sales etc.
